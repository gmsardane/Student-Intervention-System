# Creating a Student Intervention System

### The goal of this project is to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate. 
This classification problem employs various classifiers in Python to test for accuracy and efficiency. The classifiers 
tested are:

+ Support Vector Machines
+ Decision Tree Classifiers
+ AdaBoosted Decision Trees.

### The most efficient and accurate classifier is chosen.

## Tools/Software Requirements:
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

Python 2.7
NumPy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn (v0.17) [SVC, DT, AdaBoost, metrics]

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.
